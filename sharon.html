   	        		<p> Precision Farming – Harvesting more bushels per acre while spending less on fertilizer using precision farming and software.  Disease Control – Combating the spread of pests through by identifying critical intervention areas and efficient targeting control interventions. Real-time Crop Yields – Shifting to real-time crop monitoring and targeted, automated responses with drones and precision watering sensors.Current Food Security – Safeguarding food insecure populations by establishing underlying causes through satellite, mobile-collected and GIS data storage.hine Performance – Logging geographic coordinates of agricultural machinery in a farm field to better understand the spatially variability cost of field operation and machinery performance.</p>
